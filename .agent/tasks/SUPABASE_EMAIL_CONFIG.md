# Supabase Email Verification Configuration

## Important: Expo Go vs Standalone App

**You are currently using Expo Go!** This means email verification with deep links won't work the traditional way.

### For Expo Go Development:

- Custom schemes like `HearSay://` don't work in Expo Go
- You need to use a **web-based callback** instead
- The user will verify in a browser, then return to the app

### For Production (Standalone App):

- After running `npx expo prebuild` and creating a standalone build
- Custom schemes like `HearSay://` will work
- Email links will directly open your app

## Required Manual Configuration Steps

Since email templates and some auth settings can only be configured through the Supabase Dashboard, please complete these steps manually:

### 1. Configure Redirect URLs

**Path**: Supabase Dashboard â†’ Authentication â†’ URL Configuration

**For Expo Go (Development):**
Add your Expo development URL to "Redirect URLs":

```
exp://YOUR-IP-ADDRESS:8081
https://auth.expo.io/@YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-SLUG
```

**For Standalone App (Production):**

```
HearSay://auth/callback
HearSay://**
```

To get your Expo development URL, run `npx expo start` and look for the URL in the terminal.

### 2. Customize Email Template

**Path**: Supabase Dashboard â†’ Authentication â†’ Email Templates â†’ Confirm signup

**Replace the template with this:**

```html
<h2>Welcome to HearSay Japan! ðŸŽ‰</h2>

<p>Hi there,</p>

<p>
  Thank you for signing up with your school email. Please verify your email
  address by clicking the button below:
</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin: 32px 0;">
  <a
    href="{{ .ConfirmationURL }}"
    style="background-color: #FFCC00; color: #1C1C1E; padding: 14px 32px; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 20px; display: inline-block; font-weight: 600; font-size: 16px;"
  >
    Verify Email Address
  </a>
</p>

<p style="color: #8E8E93; font-size: 14px;">
  This link will expire in 24 hours.
</p>

<p style="color: #8E8E93; font-size: 14px;">
  If you didn't create an account with HearSay Japan, you can safely ignore this
  email.
</p>

<hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid #E5E5EA; margin: 32px 0;" />

<p style="color: #AEAEB2; font-size: 12px; text-align: center;">
  HearSay Japan - Connect with your university community
</p>
```

**Important Notes for Expo Go:**

- **Use `{{ .ConfirmationURL }}`** - This is correct for Expo Go! ([Reference](https://supabase.com/blog/react-native-authentication))
- The link opens in the browser, verifies the email, then closes
- The app automatically detects the verified session when it returns to foreground
- **NO custom deep links needed in Expo Go!**
- This template works for both Expo Go AND standalone builds

### 3. How Email Verification Works in Expo Go

When the user clicks "Verify Email Address" in the email:

1. **Browser opens** with the Supabase confirmation URL
2. **Supabase verifies** the token on the server
3. **Session is created** and stored in AsyncStorage
4. **Browser closes** automatically (or user closes it)
5. **User returns to app** (manually or automatically)
6. **App detects session** via `onAuthStateChange` in `useAuth.js`
7. **User is authenticated!** ðŸŽ‰

**The deep link handler in `_layout.jsx` is NOT used in Expo Go** - the session is detected automatically via Supabase's `onAuthStateChange` listener.

### 4. Verify Email Confirmation is Enabled

**Path**: Supabase Dashboard â†’ Authentication â†’ Providers â†’ Email

**Check these settings:**

- âœ… "Confirm email" should be **enabled**
- âœ… "Secure email change" should be **enabled** (recommended)

### 5. Optional: Create Schools Table (Future Enhancement)

If you want to prepare for multiple schools, run this in the SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Schools table for multi-university support
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.schools (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  email_domain TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Insert Waseda
INSERT INTO public.schools (name, email_domain)
VALUES ('Waseda University', 'waseda.jp')
ON CONFLICT (name) DO NOTHING;

-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE public.schools ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Public read policy (anyone can see available schools)
CREATE POLICY "Schools are publicly readable"
  ON public.schools
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated, anon
  USING (is_active = true);

-- Add comment
COMMENT ON TABLE public.schools IS 'List of universities/schools that can use the app';
```

## Testing the Configuration

### Test Email Verification Flow:

1. **Sign Up**:

   - Navigate to login screen
   - Click "Sign Up"
   - Select "Waseda University"
   - Enter email with @waseda.jp domain
   - Enter password and confirm
   - Click "Create Account"

2. **Verify Email Screen**:

   - Should see "Check Your Email" screen
   - Email address should be displayed
   - Can click "Resend Email" (with 60s cooldown)

3. **Check Email**:

   - Open email from Supabase
   - Should have HearSay Japan branding
   - Click "Verify Email Address" button

4. **Browser Verification (Expo Go)**:

   - **Browser opens** (in-app or external)
   - You'll see a Supabase confirmation page
   - Wait a moment for verification
   - **Close the browser** (or it closes automatically)
   - **Return to the Expo Go app**

5. **App Detects Session**:

   - The app automatically detects your verified session
   - You'll be redirected to **onboarding** screen
   - (You might need to reload or bring app to foreground)

6. **Complete Onboarding**:
   - Enter username, nickname, bio
   - Should redirect to home screen

### Common Issues and Solutions:

**Issue**: "Invalid email domain" error

- **Solution**: Make sure email ends with `@waseda.jp`

**Issue**: Email not received

- **Solution**:
  - Check spam folder
  - Wait a few minutes (email delivery can be delayed)
  - Click "Resend Email" button
  - Verify email configuration in Supabase Dashboard

**Issue**: Deep link doesn't open app

- **Solution**:
  - On iOS: Make sure app.json has `"scheme": "HearSay"`
  - On Android: Check AndroidManifest.xml has intent-filter
  - Rebuild app with `npx expo prebuild`

**Issue**: "Token expired" error

- **Solution**:
  - Email links expire after 24 hours
  - Request a new verification email
  - Check that user clicked the link in time

**Issue**: Stuck on verify-email screen after verification

- **Solution**:
  - Manually navigate back to login
  - Try signing in with verified credentials
  - Check if session was created in Supabase Dashboard

**Issue**: Browser shows "Confirmation successful" but app doesn't redirect to onboarding

- **Solution (Expo Go)**:
  - **This is normal!** The browser won't auto-redirect in Expo Go
  - **Close the browser manually**
  - **Go back to your Expo Go app**
  - The app should detect the session and redirect you to onboarding
  - If it doesn't, try pulling down to refresh on the verify-email screen
  - The session is stored in AsyncStorage, so it persists

**Issue**: Email link opens but shows error page

- **Solution**:
  - Check that you're using `{{ .ConfirmationURL }}` in the email template (NOT a custom URL)
  - Verify email confirmation is enabled in Supabase Dashboard
  - Try a different browser or clear browser cache
  - Check Supabase Dashboard â†’ Auth â†’ Users to see if email was verified
