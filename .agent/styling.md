üé® UI Design Description for Claude

Overall Style:
Design a modern, minimalist interface that blends the clarity and layout of Coinbase, the warmth and personality of Clubhouse, and the geometric simplicity of Artifact.
The app should feel clean, editorial, spacious, and professional ‚Äî not playful or childish. Focus on generous whitespace, confident bold typography, and subtle geometric accents.

üß© Layout and Structure

Use a grid-based layout with clear spacing and alignment similar to Coinbase's card and section organization.

SPACIOUSNESS IS KEY: Each screen should have generous breathing room with consistent padding:
- Screen edges: 20‚Äì24px horizontal padding
- Between sections: 32‚Äì48px vertical spacing
- Card internal padding: 20‚Äì24px
- Component spacing: 16‚Äì24px

Visual hierarchy defined by text weight, size, and spacing rather than heavy borders or shadows.

Use a 4px-based spacing scale: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40, 48, 64px for consistency.

Employ mostly flat elements with minimal shadows (only on interactive cards).

Top navigation is simple and fixed, with a clear title and right-aligned utility icons (48px touch targets).

Bottom navigation should have 4‚Äì5 icons with clear labels (like Coinbase), 56px height minimum.

üé® Color Palette (Artifact-inspired)

Primary background: Light gray (#F8F9FA) for app background
Card background: Pure white (#FFFFFF)
Primary text: Black (#000000)

Accent Pale Blue: #B7D4FF (used for highlights, illustrations, decorative elements, and secondary actions)
Accent Orange: #FF5A1F (used for important CTAs, alerts, and vibrant accents)

Primary CTA Colors:
- Black (#000000) for primary buttons and bold actions
- Orange (#FF5A1F) for secondary important actions
- Pale Blue (#B7D4FF) for tertiary actions or backgrounds

Grays / Neutrals:
- Light gray background: #F8F9FA
- Card borders: #E5E7EB (1px solid)
- Divider gray: #E5E7EB
- Secondary text: #6B7280
- Disabled text: #9CA3AF

Overall, the color contrast should feel bold but clean, emphasizing black and white with subtle injections of pale blue and orange for vibrance and personality.

üî§ Typography

Primary Font: Instrument Sans
- Clean geometric feel, fits both editorial and tech branding
- Alternative Option: Space Grotesk for stronger geometric identity

Font Sizes & Weights:
- Hero/Display: 32‚Äì48px, weight 700‚Äì800 (extra bold)

Line height: 1.5 for body text, 1.2‚Äì1.3 for headings.

Avoid decorative or rounded fonts to maintain a professional tone.

üß± Corner Rounding & Shapes

Pills/Tabs: 20‚Äì24px border radius

Theming with Gluestack:
Configure custom theme to match Artifact palette:
```typescript
const config = {
  tokens: {
    colors: {
      primary: '#000000',
      secondary: '#FF5A1F',
      accent: '#B7D4FF',

      sm: 8,
      md: 16,
      lg: 24,
      xl: 32,
      '2xl': 48,
    },
    radii: {
      sm: 8,
      md: 12,
      lg: 16,
      xl: 24,
      full: 9999,
