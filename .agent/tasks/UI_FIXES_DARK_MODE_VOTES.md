# UI Fixes: Dark Mode & Vote Visibility

**Date:** 2025-10-27
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Avatar Oval Shape → Circular ✅
**Problem:** Avatar components were appearing as ovals instead of perfect circles when placed in flex containers.

**Root Cause:** Missing aspect ratio enforcement allowed flex containers to stretch the avatar.

**Solution:** Added `aspectRatio: 1` to Avatar component styling.

**File Modified:**
- `YikYak/src/components/ui/Avatar.jsx` - Added aspectRatio: 1 to ensure circular shape

### 2. Dark Mode White-on-White Text ✅
**Problem:** In dark mode, several UI elements had white text on white backgrounds, making them invisible:
- Create post FAB button (+ icon)
- New/Popular tab toggle text and icons
- Time filter buttons (Day/Week/Month)
- Send buttons in chat and post detail screens

**Root Cause:** Hardcoded `"#FFFFFF"` colors instead of using theme's `colors.primaryText` which adapts to dark mode.

**Solution:** Replaced all 10 instances of hardcoded `"#FFFFFF"` with `colors.primaryText`:
- Light mode: `primaryText = "#FFFFFF"` (white text on black buttons)
- Dark mode: `primaryText = "#000000"` (black text on white buttons)

**Files Modified:**
- `YikYak/src/app/(tabs)/home.jsx` - 6 fixes:
  - Line 401: Clock icon in "New" tab
  - Line 407: "New" tab text
  - Line 430: TrendingUp icon in "Popular" tab
  - Line 436: "Popular" tab text
  - Line 473: Time filter button text
  - Line 571: Plus icon in FAB button
  
- `YikYak/src/app/post/[id].jsx` - 2 fixes:
  - Line 349: ActivityIndicator in send button
  - Line 351: Send icon
  
- `YikYak/src/app/chat/[id].jsx` - 2 fixes:
  - Line 262: ActivityIndicator in send button
  - Line 264: Send icon

### 3. Vote Button Colors Too Subtle ✅
**Problem:** When users upvoted or downvoted posts, the color change was barely noticeable:
- Upvote used `primarySubtle` (rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05) in light mode) - almost invisible
- The visual feedback was too weak for users to know their vote was registered

**Root Cause:** Using `primarySubtle` background which has very low opacity (5% in light mode, 10% in dark mode).

**Solution:** Changed upvote styling to use accent color (pale blue #B7D4FF) for much better visibility:
- Background: `colors.accentSubtle` (30% opacity pale blue)
- Icon: `colors.accent` (full pale blue)
- Text: `colors.accent` (full pale blue)
- Downvote: Changed to use `colors.error` (red) for consistency

**Files Modified:**
- `YikYak/src/app/(tabs)/home.jsx` - Post card vote buttons:
  - Changed upvote background from `primarySubtle` to `accentSubtle`
  - Changed upvote icon/text color from `primary` to `accent`
  
- `YikYak/src/app/post/[id].jsx` - Comment vote buttons:
  - Changed upvote icon/fill color from `primary` to `accent`
  - Changed downvote icon/fill color from `secondary` to `error` for consistency

## Visual Impact

### Before:
- ❌ Avatars appeared stretched/oval in some layouts
- ❌ Dark mode: White text invisible on white backgrounds
- ❌ Upvoted posts barely distinguishable from non-voted posts
- ❌ Users couldn't tell if their vote registered

### After:
- ✅ All avatars are perfect circles
- ✅ Dark mode: All text properly visible with correct contrast
- ✅ Upvoted posts clearly highlighted with pale blue accent
- ✅ Downvoted posts clearly highlighted with red
- ✅ Strong visual feedback for all interactions

## Design System Updates

**Vote Button Colors:**
- **Upvoted:** Pale blue accent (#B7D4FF / #A0C4FF in dark mode)
- **Downvoted:** Red error (#EF4444 / #FF6B6B in dark mode)
- **Neutral:** Gray secondary text (#6B7280 / #A0A0A0 in dark mode)

This creates a clear visual hierarchy:
- Blue = positive/upvote
- Red = negative/downvote
- Gray = neutral/no vote
