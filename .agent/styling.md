🎨 Overall Style

These screens are from Headspace, a meditation app known for its soft, uplifting, and minimalistic design.
The UI combines friendly rounded shapes, bold typography, and warm pastel colors to create a calming and approachable experience.

🧩 Layout and Structure
1. Navigation & Layout

Each screen has a top navigation bar with the time (9:41), signal/Wi-Fi/battery icons, and sometimes a simple “Back” button.

The bottom navigation bar contains 3 icons:

“Today” (home icon)

“Explore” (grid icon)

“Profile” (person icon)

The layout is vertically scrollable, using a card-based design for tasks or courses.

Spacing is generous — lots of white space between elements to reduce visual clutter.

🧠 Typography

Uses Headspace’s signature geometric sans-serif font (similar to Circular Std or Proxima Nova).

Font hierarchy:

Large headings: Bold, black (#1C1C1E), around 24–32px.

Subheadings / labels: Medium, gray (#8E8E93), around 16px.

Descriptions: Regular, light gray (#AEAEB2), around 14px.

Centered text on meditation screens (“Breathe in”) uses large, bold, dark gray text for focus.

🎨 Color Palette

The color scheme is warm, cheerful, and balanced:

Element	Color	Description
Primary Yellow	#FFCC00	Bright, positive tone for highlights and cards
Headspace Orange	#FF9B42	Used in meditation characters and backgrounds
Soft Beige / Cream	#FFF9F3	Background tone to soften contrast
Light Gray	#F2F2F7	Card or inactive background color
Accent Blue	#007AFF	Call-to-action buttons like “Start Course”
Text Black	#1C1C1E	Primary text
Text Gray	#8E8E93	Secondary text

The color contrast feels intentionally low and soothing — not overly bright or sharp.

🖼️ Imagery and Illustration Style

Illustrations are flat, vector-based, and rounded — similar to modern cartoons.

Use simple geometric shapes (circles, arcs) and minimal facial features (eyes, smile).

The orange blob character with closed eyes symbolizes calm and meditation.

Images are used inside rounded rectangles, with no shadows, emphasizing cleanliness.

🧱 Cards and Corner Rounding

Cards (like “Getting Started with Headspace” or “Grounding Exercise”) use:

Rounded corners: 20–24px radius

Subtle shadow or light gray border

Contain small illustrations on the right and text on the left.

Each card includes:

A title (bold black text)

A subtitle (activity type + duration)

A small icon (e.g., video, mindful activity)

A 3-dot menu button for options.
