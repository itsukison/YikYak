# Task: Frontend Supabase Integration

**Status:** � Phtase 1-3 Complete
**Created:** 2025-10-21
**Updated:** 2025-10-21
**Priority:** High (Backend is ready, needs frontend connection)

---

## 📋 Overview

Connect all frontend screens to Supabase backend. Currently, all screens use mock data and hardcoded user IDs. Need to integrate real authentication and database queries.

---

## 🔍 Issues Identified

### 1. **Home Screen (Feed)** - `src/app/(tabs)/home.jsx`
**Current Issues:**
- ❌ Uses mock `currentUser` with hardcoded ID
- ❌ Uses sample posts instead of real Supabase data
- ❌ Fetches from non-existent `/api/posts` endpoint
- ❌ Vote system calls fake API instead of Supabase
- ❌ No real-time subscriptions for new posts
- ❌ Location permission requested but not used with Supabase

**Required Changes:**
- Import `useAuth` hook to get real user
- Replace `fetchPosts()` with Supabase RPC call to `get_posts_within_radius()`
- Replace `handleVote()` with Supabase `handle_post_vote()` function
- Add Supabase realtime subscription for new posts
- Fetch user's existing votes on mount
- Use React Query for caching and optimistic updates

### 2. **Create Post Screen** - `src/app/create-post.jsx`
**Current Issues:**
- ❌ Uses mock `currentUser` with hardcoded ID and nickname
- ❌ Posts to non-existent `/api/posts` endpoint
- ❌ Doesn't respect user's `is_anonymous` setting from profile
- ❌ No validation for post content length (should be max 500 chars)
- ❌ Hardcoded location name "University of Tokyo"

**Required Changes:**
- Import `useAuth` hook to get real user and profile
- Use `profile.is_anonymous` for initial anonymous toggle state
- Insert post directly into Supabase `posts` table
- Update character limit to 500 (matches database constraint)
- Use reverse geocoding or let user select location name
- Navigate back to feed after successful post creation

### 3. **Profile Screen** - `src/app/(tabs)/profile.jsx`
**Current Issues:**
- ✅ Already connected to `useAuth` (fixed in Phase 3)
- ❌ Mock stats (follower_count, following_count, post_count) showing 0
- ❌ Anonymous toggle updates database but doesn't sync with create-post screen

**Required Changes:**
- Query actual post count from `posts` table
- Query follower/following counts from `follows` table
- Ensure anonymous mode syncs across app

### 4. **Messages Screen** - `src/app/(tabs)/messages.jsx`
**Current Issues:**
- ❌ Shows empty state only
- ❌ No chat list implementation
- ❌ No way to start new conversations

**Required Changes:**
- Query user's chats from `chats` table
- Display chat list with last message preview
- Show unread message count
- Add realtime subscription for new messages
- Implement chat detail screen
- Add ability to start new chat with followed users

### 5. **Notifications Screen** - `src/app/(tabs)/notification.jsx`
**Current Issues:**
- ❌ Shows empty state only
- ❌ No notifications table in database
- ❌ No notification system implemented

**Required Changes:**
- Create `notifications` table in database (Phase 4)
- Implement notification triggers (new comment, vote, follow, message)
- Display notification list
- Mark notifications as read
- Add realtime subscription for new notifications

## 🎯 Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Home Screen Integration (Priority: Critical)
**Goal:** Connect feed to real Supabase data with location-based queries

**Steps:**
1. Import `useAuth` and `supabase` client
2. Replace mock user with real user from auth
3. Create `fetchPostsFromSupabase()` function:
   ```javascript
   const { data, error } = await supabase.rpc('get_posts_within_radius', {
     user_lat: latitude,
     user_lon: longitude,
     radius_meters: radius,
     sort_by: activeTab,
     limit_count: 20
   });
   ```
4. Fetch user's existing votes on mount:
   ```javascript
   const { data: userVotes } = await supabase
     .from('votes_posts')
     .select('post_id, vote_type')
     .eq('user_id', user.id);
   ```
5. Update `handleVote()` to use Supabase:
   ```javascript
   const { error } = await supabase.rpc('handle_post_vote', {
     p_user_id: user.id,
     p_post_id: postId,
     p_vote_type: voteType
   });
   ```
6. Add realtime subscription:
   ```javascript
   const subscription = supabase
     .channel('posts')
     .on('postgres_changes', 
       { event: 'INSERT', schema: 'public', table: 'posts' },
       (payload) => {
         // Add new post to feed if within radius
       }
     )
     .subscribe();
   ```

- ⏳ Test realtime updates (create post in one device, see on another)
- ⏳ Test anonymous mode toggle syncing

### 2025-10-21 - Auth Guards & Route Protection ✅

**Issues Fixed:**
- ❌ Profile showing "Anonymous User" when profile not loaded
- ❌ Users could access app pages without being logged in
- ❌ Sign out button not working properly
- ❌ Auth routing not properly protecting routes

**Changes Made:**

**1. Improved Root Layout Auth Routing (`src/app/_layout.jsx`):**
- ✅ Better auth state checking with proper loading states
- ✅ Waits for profile to load before routing decisions
- ✅ Prevents access to protected routes without authentication
- ✅ Proper redirect flow: No user → Login, User without onboarding → Onboarding, User with onboarding → Home

**2. Added Auth Guards to All Protected Screens:**
- ✅ `src/app/(tabs)/home.jsx` - Redirects to login if no user
- ✅ `src/app/create-post.jsx` - Redirects to login if no user, shows loading if profile not loaded
- ✅ `src/app/(tabs)/profile.jsx` - Redirects to login if no user, shows loading if profile not loaded, syncs anonymous state with profile

**3. Protected Tabs Layout (`src/app/(tabs)/_layout.jsx`):**
- ✅ Added auth guard to prevent rendering tabs without authentication
- ✅ Redirects to login if user tries to access tabs without being logged in

**4. Improved useAuth Hook (`src/utils/auth/useAuth.js`):**
- ✅ Better error handling when profile fetch fails
- ✅ Sets profile to null if fetch fails (instead of leaving it undefined)
- ✅ Proper loading state management

**Auth Flow Now:**
1. App starts → Check session in AsyncStorage
2. If no session → Redirect to /login
3. If session exists → Fetch profile from database
4. If profile not found or onboarding incomplete → Redirect to /onboarding
5. If profile complete → Allow access to app
6. All protected routes check for user before rendering
7. Sign out clears session and redirects to login

### 2025-10-21 - White Screen & Redirect Loop Fixes ✅

**Issue 1: White Screen on /home**
- **Root Cause:** Individual screens were calling `router.replace('/login')` which conflicted with root layout's routing logic, causing redirect loops
- **Fix:** Removed redirect logic from individual screens (home, profile, create-post), they now just show loading states
- **Result:** Root layout is now the single source of truth for all auth routing

**Issue 2: Onboarding Redirect Loop**
- **Root Cause:** Race condition where onboarding screen called `router.replace('/(tabs)/home')` before the profile state updated in useAuth, causing root layout to redirect back to onboarding
- **Fix:** Removed manual navigation from onboarding screen, let root layout handle navigation automatically after profile state updates
- **Result:** Smooth transition from onboarding to home screen

**Changes Made:**
1. **Centralized Auth Routing (`src/app/_layout.jsx`):**
   - ✅ Added console logging for debugging routing decisions
   - ✅ Improved segment detection for direct URL access
   - ✅ Better handling of loading states
   - ✅ Single source of truth for all navigation

2. **Removed Conflicting Guards:**
   - ✅ `src/app/(tabs)/home.jsx` - Changed from redirect to loading state
   - ✅ `src/app/(tabs)/profile.jsx` - Changed from redirect to loading state
   - ✅ `src/app/create-post.jsx` - Changed from redirect to loading state
   - ✅ `src/app/(tabs)/_layout.jsx` - Simplified to just return null if no user

3. **Fixed Onboarding Flow (`src/app/onboarding.jsx`):**
   - ✅ Removed `router.replace('/(tabs)/home')` after profile update
   - ✅ Let root layout handle navigation automatically
   - ✅ Added console logging for debugging
   - ✅ Profile state updates trigger automatic navigation

4. **Enhanced useAuth Hook (`src/utils/auth/useAuth.js`):**
   - ✅ Added console logging to track profile updates
   - ✅ Better error handling and logging

**Auth Flow (Final):**
1. App starts → Check AsyncStorage for session
2. No session → Root layout redirects to `/login`
3. Session exists → Fetch profile from database
4. Profile incomplete → Root layout redirects to `/onboarding`
5. User completes onboarding → Profile updates → Root layout automatically navigates to home
6. Profile complete → Allow access to app
7. Sign out → Clear session → Root layout redirects to login
