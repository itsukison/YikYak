🎨 UI Design Description for Claude

Overall Style:
Design a modern, minimalist interface that blends the clarity and layout of Coinbase, the warmth and personality of Clubhouse, and the geometric simplicity of Artifact.
The app should feel clean, editorial, and professional — not playful or childish. Focus on balance, whitespace, and confident typography.

🧩 Layout and Structure

Use a grid-based layout with clear spacing and alignment similar to Coinbase’s card and section organization.

Each screen should have ample breathing room, consistent padding (16–24px), and visual hierarchy defined by text weight and spacing rather than borders or shading.

Employ flat elements — minimal shadows, solid fills, and clean dividers.

Top navigation is simple and fixed, with a clear title and right-aligned utility icons.

Bottom navigation should have 4–5 icons with clear labels (like Coinbase).

🎨 Color Palette (Artifact-inspired)

Primary background: White (#FFFFFF)

Primary text: Black (#000000)

Accent Blue: #B7D4FF (used sparingly for highlights or illustrations)

Accent Orange: #FF5A1F (used for primary CTAs like buttons)

Grays / Neutrals:

Light gray background sections (#F8F9FB)

Divider gray (#E5E7EB)

Overall, the color contrast should feel bold but clean, emphasizing black and white with subtle injections of orange and blue for vibrance.

🔤 Typography

Primary Font: Instrument Sans

Clean geometric feel, fits both editorial and tech branding.

Alternative Option: Space Grotesk
 for stronger geometric identity.

Use bold weights for headings, regular for body text.

Avoid decorative or rounded fonts to maintain a professional tone.

🧱 Corner Rounding & Shapes

Keep medium rounding (6–8px) for cards and containers.

Use strong rounding (20–24px) only for buttons or profile images.

Avoid overly rounded corners — aim for sharp yet friendly edges like Coinbase.

🪄 Iconography

Use a professional vector icon library (e.g., Lucide Icons
 or Feather Icons
).

Avoid emojis — icons should represent meaning clearly with line consistency.

Use outlined icons for navigation and solid icons for key actions (e.g., microphone, message, add).
